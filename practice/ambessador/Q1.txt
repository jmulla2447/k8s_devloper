Scenario:

You have a legacy application that needs to communicate with an external service, but it requires an ambassador container to handle the communication.

Task:

Create a pod named ambassador-app with a main application container and an ambassador container. The main application uses the image nginx:latest. The ambassador container uses the image haproxy:latest to proxy requests to an external service at external-service.local.

Additional Instructions:

Ensure the ambassador container proxies requests from the main application to external-service.local.
Use the default namespace.

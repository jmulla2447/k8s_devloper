Scenario:

You have a pod that needs to initialize some configuration files before the main application starts.

Task:

Create a pod named init-app with an init container and a main application container. The init container should use the image busybox:latest to create a file /config/init.txt with the content Initialization complete. The main application container should use the image nginx:latest.

Additional Instructions:

Ensure the init container runs to completion before the main application container starts.
Use a shared volume to share the file between the init container and the main application container.
Use the default namespace.

Scenario:

You have a main application that writes logs to a file, and you need to have a sidecar container to send these logs to a centralized logging system.

Task:

Create a pod named log-app with a main application container and a sidecar container. The main application uses the image nginx:latest and writes logs to /var/log/nginx/access.log. The sidecar container should use the image busybox:latest and periodically read from /var/log/nginx/access.log to simulate sending logs.

Additional Instructions:

Ensure the logs directory /var/log/nginx is shared between the main container and the sidecar container.
Use the default namespace.
